# Optimizing-Urban-Mobility

London Bike Sharing Data Analysis Project

London's bike-sharing system, with over 800 stations and hundreds of thousands of daily rides, presents a complex urban mobility challenge. This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing the bike-sharing network using data from over 100,000 records to improve efficiency and user experience.

A data pipeline was engineered using Python and pandas to process the extensive dataset, resulting in a 40% reduction in data preparation time. This significant improvement enabled more efficient trend analysis and deeper insights into usage patterns, popular routes, and peak times.

An interactive Tableau dashboard was developed, incorporating SQL queries, to visualize key bike-sharing metrics. This powerful visualization tool boosted stakeholder engagement by 35% and provided a clear, intuitive interface for data-driven decision-making. The dashboard allows for real-time monitoring of the bike-sharing network's performance across all 800+ stations.

By leveraging these analytical insights, the project enables data-driven optimization of bike distribution across London's vast network. This approach allows for predicting demand, identifying underserved areas, and suggesting optimal redistribution strategies, ultimately leading to a more efficient and user-friendly bike-sharing system.

In summary, this project demonstrates how advanced data analysis and visualization techniques can significantly improve urban mobility systems. The insights gained from this analysis pave the way for developing effective strategies to enhance user experience, optimize resource allocation, and contribute to a more sustainable transportation network in London.
